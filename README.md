## General description
The current project explores whether house sparrow (*Passer domesticus*) males differ in their ejaculate quality. The data consists of both behavioral and physiological data from 60 male house sparrows. There are two sources of data: single spermatozoon swimming tracks and behvioral plus morphological data from each male.
Within the script you will find a general explanation of how the data was acquired. Further, the script shows how the data was manipulated and analized.
The project contains 6 folders, which have all the necesary data and information to run the script.

## Folders

### 0_project_report
-find our CDR here
-the PDF version is for sigve (correction)

### 1_CASA_output
-This folder contains .txt files with a describing the swimming performance of all the spermatozoa within a single ejaculate. Each file was exported from the result table of the Computer Automatized Sperm Analizer (CASA) implemented in ImageJ. Tables do not have any column names, and the last line of each file contains a summary (means) of all the spermatozoa tracked. For further infomation about the structure of the table, refer to the Jupyter notebook containing the data management and analyses.

### 2_images
-This folder contains figures that are used for explanation purposes in the Jupyter notebook.

### 3_data
-This folder contains the behavioral and morphological data from 60 male house sparrows.

### 4_sperm_video_optimization
-Optimization for parameters for the CASA plug-in in ImageJ

### 5_poster
-poster for presentation
